Using OUTBACK ROADIES:

Permission is not given to redistribute any part of Outback Roadies.
This includes as a complete mod, or any of the assets contained within.

Redistributing Outback Roadies will cause licensing issues for assets that are paid for, and increases the potential for a file mismatch.
For more information, read the TFP Guidelines on Modding Policy.
